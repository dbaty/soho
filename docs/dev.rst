Soho is hosted on GitHub at `<https://github.com/dbaty/Soho>`_. Feel
free to report bugs and provide feedback there. Soho has a test suite
that contains both unit tests, integration tests and functional tests
which you may run with ``make test`` (that uses your own Python) or
``tox`` (that uses Python 2.7 and Python 3.2).

Soho is written by Damien Baty and is licensed under the 3-clause BSD
