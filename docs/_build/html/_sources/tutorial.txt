Tutorial
========

The goal of this tutorial is to show most features of Soho, step by
step. We will first start with the basics, add assets, then show how
to use metadata and pass bindings to the templates, and conclude with
internationalization. All sections (except the last one about
internationalization) use the same set of files that are progressively
updated. The resources (source and configuration files) of each
section of this tutorial can be found in the `docs/_tutorial
<https://github.com/dbaty/Soho/tree/master/docs/_tutorial>`_ folder in
the source.
